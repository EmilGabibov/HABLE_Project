# Future Split Guidance

*Updated from completed tasks through 2026-07-13 21:09 CEST.*
*Last future-guidance prompt extracted from active/completed queue: 2026-07-13 21:09 CEST (`Clarify The Difference Between Leaderboard Totals, Profile Gamification, And Per-Log Points Surfaces`).*
*Resume future extraction from the first later completed task in `Task2_Archived.md` or newly archived items added after this timestamp.*
*Backlog reconciliation note on 2026-07-13 23:01 CEST: several former future-only bullets were promoted into active engineered tasks in `Task1_Engineered.md`; this file now keeps only the still-deferred split guidance to avoid duplicate ownership.*

This document aggregates the still-relevant "Future split guidance" from recently completed Hable tasks. It is organized by delivery priority and implementation hardness so future raw tasks can be added with less duplication and less scope creep.

## Priority 1: Reliability, Sync Integrity, Testing, and Release Operations
*These items protect Hable's offline-first contract, multi-user correctness, and release safety.*

### Easy
- **Social Integrity Cleanup Follow-Ups:** If more edge cases appear, split targeted fixes for reciprocal-request UX, deleted-account reconciliation, or local social-cache cleanup instead of broad social refactors.
  - *Source tasks:* `Harden Self-Friend Request Guarding And Social Cache Cleanup`.
  - *User perspective:* Friends/search states stay trustworthy and do not show ghost or impossible relationships.

### Medium
- **Automated Device Smoke Harness:** If manual ADB verification keeps recurring, split a small automated smoke harness for install/reset/auth/home/social critical paths.
  - *Source tasks:* `Run ADB Smoke Tests For Auth, Friend Harness, And Recent UI Changes`.
  - *User perspective:* Fewer regressions reach a manual tester before being caught.

- **Environment-Based Backend Targeting:** If release Android/web builds need something stronger than `kDebugMode`, split a task for explicit environment-based API configuration.
  - *Source tasks:* Android APK verification and manual smoke guidance.
  - *User perspective:* Test builds and production builds talk to the correct backend reliably.

- **Backend-Driven Web Push For PWA Reminders:** If Hable requires true closed-browser re-engagement, split a dedicated infrastructure task for web-push service workers and VAPID. The current local reminder system cannot schedule closed-app deliveries on web.
  - *Source tasks:* `Define Platform-Specific Habit Reminder Delivery For Android macOS Windows And PWA`.
  - *User perspective:* PWA users get reliable notifications even when the Hable tab is closed, matching native platforms.

### Hard
- **Authentication Hardening Beyond MVP:** Add refresh rotation, revocation, account deletion/export, stronger abuse telemetry, production email hardening, passkeys/OAuth, or multi-device session management as separate auth tasks.
  - *Source tasks:* auth docs, password-reset/auth tasks, JWT-auth tasks.
  - *User perspective:* Account security feels production-ready rather than prototype-grade.

- **Desktop and Store Distribution Tracks:** Keep macOS App Store + standalone distribution, Windows installer/standalone packaging, Play Console metadata, app links, and store-release hardening as separate release-engineering tasks.
  - *Source tasks:* platform build integrity tasks, Android signing/package identity tasks.
  - *User perspective:* Installing Hable from each platform feels official and low-friction.

## Priority 2: Social Product Depth and Multi-User Scale
*These items grow Hable beyond the current accepted-friend + shared-habit MVP.*

### Easy
- **Advanced Friend Management:** Unfriending, blocking, deleted-account handling, and clearer reciprocal-request UX should remain separate targeted tasks.
  - *Source tasks:* social integrity fixes, accepted-friend primitive tasks.
  - *User perspective:* You can control who interacts with you and clean up stale relationships safely.

### Medium
- **Partner and Invite Flow Expansion:** Split follow-ups for partner management after creation, invite cancellation, bulk invites, friend search inside the form, or habit invite from create/edit surfaces.
  - *Source tasks:* habit creation/Home add tasks, accepted-friend primitive tasks.
  - *User perspective:* Shared-habit setup becomes flexible without making the current create flow confusing.

- **Three-Player Social QA Harness:** Expand browser automation from the current two-user loop into deterministic three-user invite/nudge/follow scenarios.
  - *Source tasks:* web multi-user plan, Playwright regression harness.
  - *User perspective:* Multi-user features keep working when the social graph is larger than one pair.

### Hard
- **Follow Model and Friend Activity Feed:** Durable "follow habit" relationships, friend activity feeds, public habit templates, richer encouragement messages, and recommendation logic should be split out from the current MVP social model.
  - *Source tasks:* friend-profile/nudge/follow-related tasks.
  - *User perspective:* Social feels like an ecosystem rather than a narrow invite-only workflow.

## Priority 3: UX, Gamification, and Product Polish
*These items improve feel, delight, and larger-surface product expression after the core loop is stable.*

### Easy
- **Visual Density and Layout Follow-Ups:** If more inconsistencies remain, split targeted web layout polish, card-spacing cleanup, or fuller responsive passes rather than broad redesigns.
  - *Source tasks:* `Top-Align Primary Content And Remove Wasted Vertical Space`.
  - *User perspective:* The app feels tighter and more intentional across phone and web.

- **Completion and Haptic Polish:** Platform-specific gesture tuning, advanced haptic choreography, or richer completion celebrations should stay separate from correctness fixes.
  - *Source tasks:* hold-cancel fix, inline completion reset, completion splash.
  - *User perspective:* Check-ins feel more satisfying without changing the rules.

### Medium
- **Achievement and History Expansion:** Shareable completion certificates, milestone recap cards, richer history pages, or a unified "Achievements & History" redesign should build on the new archive/history lane as separate work.
  - *Source tasks:* `Auto-Archive Completed Habits Into Profile History And Expand Lifecycle Actions`.
  - *User perspective:* Finished habits and milestones become easier to revisit and celebrate.

- **Shareable Achievement Card Expansion:** Add template variants, stronger OS share-sheet support, PDF certificates, or optional server-rendered assets as a focused sharing task.
  - *Source tasks:* achievement/share follow-ups.
  - *User perspective:* Accomplishments are easier to share in polished formats.

- **Mud Personalization:** Dynamic per-user mud tuning, haptic calibration presets, and persistent mud preferences should remain a separate interaction-settings task.
  - *Source tasks:* mud-resistance alignment work.
  - *User perspective:* The signature hold interaction can match different users and devices better.

- **Onboarding Variant Expansion:** Animated illustrations, personalized onboarding variants, reminder permission priming, social invite capture during onboarding, or A/B experimentation should stay as separate onboarding tasks rather than expanding the current slide/setup flow.
  - *Source tasks:* research-backed onboarding slides task, first-run quote splash work.
  - *User perspective:* First-run education can grow richer without destabilizing the low-friction auth/setup path.

- **Quote Engine Expansion:** Locale-aware quotes, copy moderation/review, multiple tags/categories, remote experiments, or quote-engagement analytics should remain separate from the current bounded daily quote integration.
  - *Source tasks:* external quote API integration, contextual fallback quote work.
  - *User perspective:* The app can get smarter or broader quote content later without weakening the current offline-safe daily quote path.

- **Score-Surface Copy And Sync Follow-Ups:** If the clarified scoring contract reveals stale sync timing, confusing point terminology, or friend-profile/leaderboard mismatch, split those into targeted product or sync tasks instead of reopening the entire scoring model.
  - *Source tasks:* leaderboard/profile/per-log points clarification task.
  - *User perspective:* Lifetime ranking, profile progression, and per-check-in rewards stay understandable even as more progression surfaces are added.

- **Empty-Day and Streak Moments:** Split specific tasks for empty-day encouragement states, streak-specific haptics, shared-habit celebration feedback, or richer quote-driven moment design.
  - *Source tasks:* scoring/habit-state document, completion splash task.
  - *User perspective:* The app responds more intelligently to good days, missed days, and streaks.

- **Accessibility Mode Expansion:** Dedicated reduced-motion controls, higher-contrast variants, alternative feedback channels, or accessibility-specific onboarding/help should stay separate from the baseline accessibility compatibility pass.
  - *Source tasks:* `Audit And Raise Accessibility Compatibility Across Mobile Desktop And Web Surfaces`.
  - *User perspective:* Accessibility can deepen over time without blocking the baseline compatibility contract.

- **Localized Content Operations:** Locale-specific quote sourcing, translated fallback-content governance, regional experimentation, or backend-delivered multilingual content should remain separate from the first-party Flutter localization baseline.
  - *Source tasks:* `Expand Hable Localization To English German Urdu Russian Tamil And Persian`, quote-engine follow-ups.
  - *User perspective:* More languages and smarter localized content can grow after the app shell itself is consistently multilingual.

### Hard
- **Seasonal Leaderboards and Score Resets:** Seasonal ladders/reset policy, richer score-history surfaces, badge ceremonies, and QA for score-event idempotency should remain separate from the current cumulative scoring system.
  - *Source tasks:* scoring/gamification documentation, server-side gamification tasks.
  - *User perspective:* Competition can reset fairly without destabilizing lifetime progress.

- **Quote Source Resilience And Vendor Strategy:** If the external quote provider remains unreliable, split provider rotation, self-hosted quote curation, upstream caching policy, or certificate-health monitoring into dedicated backend/content tasks.
  - *Source tasks:* daily quote API integration and fallback-hardening work.
  - *User perspective:* Daily quotes remain dependable even if one external source degrades.

- **Tablet/Grid Dashboard Track:** A dedicated all-habits grid/dashboard, reusable `HabitTile` foundation, and large-screen IA should be a separate task from Home-card polish.
  - *Source tasks:* Home card/grid/dashboard follow-ups.
  - *User perspective:* Tablets and wide screens use space well instead of just stretching the phone layout.

- **Full Design-System or Immersive Social Worlds:** 3D habit environments, richer badge reveal systems, custom icon libraries, leaderboard visual redesign, and other broad visual-system work should remain isolated from feature tasks.
  - *Source tasks:* role/gamification polish follow-ups, visual polish tasks.
  - *User perspective:* The app can become more expressive later without destabilizing the current MVP surfaces.

## Task-Splitting Rules

- Prefer narrow correctness tasks over broad "social refactor" or "UX redesign" tasks.
- Keep offline-first ownership intact: Flutter writes locally first, Drift/Riverpod remain the UI truth, and backend work should not bypass that model.
- Treat remote push, realtime transport, store distribution, and auth hardening as infrastructure tracks, not incidental add-ons to UI tasks.
- When a follow-up is mostly QA coverage, pair it with fixing the concrete regressions that coverage reveals.
