# Hable Project Commands

Quick reference for all build, install, and deploy shell commands across platforms.

## Doppler Setup
Backend tooling uses Wrangler 4, which requires Node.js 22 or newer. Verify with
`node --version` before running the commands below.

Wrangler and `@cloudflare/workers-types` are coupled in the backend toolchain.
Dependabot groups them as `cloudflare-worker-toolchain`; update or review them
together so peer dependency ranges stay aligned.

Initialize the local Doppler project for backend secrets:
```bash
cd /Flutter/hable/backend && npm run setup:doppler
```

Run the local Pages dev server with Doppler secrets loaded:
```bash
cd /Flutter/hable/backend && npm run dev
```

Sync the Hable email secrets from Doppler `hable/dev` into the Pages project:
```bash
cd /Flutter/hable/backend && npm run sync:pages-secrets
```

The sync script always requires the Hable email/runtime keys and also passes through optional Web Push keys when present in Doppler: `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT`, and `PUSH_DISPATCH_TOKEN`. Omitting those optional keys leaves PWA push visibly unconfigured.

## Web Deployment
Deploy the web version of the Flutter app to Cloudflare Pages:
```bash
cd /Flutter/hable && \
flutter build web --release --base-href / --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=production && \
node scripts/prepare_web_service_worker.mjs && \
cd backend && \
npx wrangler pages deploy ../build/web --project-name=hable
```

`build/web` is the only release artifact root. Do not deploy
`backend/public`: it is not guaranteed to contain the current Flutter shell,
push worker, or source revision and can roll production back to a stale client.
After deployment, record the Pages deployment and source commit in the parity
evidence:

```bash
cd /Flutter/hable/backend && \
npx wrangler pages deployment list --project-name=hable
```

## CI Parity
Run the same Flutter quality gate used in GitHub Actions:
```bash
cd /Flutter/hable && \
flutter pub get && \
flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos --fatal-warnings && \
flutter test --coverage && \
flutter build web --release --base-href / --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=production && \
node scripts/prepare_web_service_worker.mjs
```

This policy keeps informational analyzer diagnostics visible in the log while
still failing CI on warnings and errors.

This is the entire current Flutter GitHub Actions gate. Android, iOS, macOS,
and Windows compile jobs are not present yet; do not describe local native
builds as CI passes. The target native matrix and artifact provenance work is
tracked in [#172](https://github.com/EmilGabibov/HABLE_Project/issues/172).

## Build Android APKs
Build the **primary** Android APK for local development:
```bash
flutter build apk --debug --flavor primary -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=local
```

Build the **partner/friend** Android APK for local development:
```bash
flutter build apk --debug --flavor friend -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=local
```

For local backend testing, debug builds now default to `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.
The backend target is resolved in this order:
1. `HABLE_API_BASE_URL` manual override
2. `HABLE_APP_ENV` preset: `local`, `staging`, or `production`
3. Fallback when no define is passed: debug/profile -> `local`, release -> `production`

`staging` currently resolves to `production` unless `HABLE_STAGING_API_BASE_URL` is also provided.

Use `adb reverse tcp:8787 tcp:8787` on a physical Android device.
If you need to target a different backend host, pass:
```bash
flutter build apk --debug --flavor primary -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=local \
  --dart-define=HABLE_API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8787
```
The override above is the usual emulator case; replace the URL as needed.

Build the **primary** Android APK for the online presentation backend:
```bash
flutter build apk --release --flavor primary -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=production
```

Build the **partner/friend** Android APK for the same production target:
```bash
flutter build apk --release --flavor friend -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=production
```

Production Android release builds fail closed when `android/key.properties`
or its referenced keystore is missing. Inject the real values through the
operator/CI secret store; never commit the file or keystore. After both APKs
build, verify their certificate and flavor identities:
```bash
scripts/verify_android_release_signing.sh \
  build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-primary-release.apk \
  build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-friend-release.apk
```

A production release artifact must not use the Android Debug certificate.
Until [#164](https://github.com/EmilGabibov/HABLE_Project/issues/164) makes the
task fail closed, always inspect both flavor certificates before treating the
build as distribution-ready.

Run the **primary** Android flavor against the online backend on a connected device:
```bash
flutter run --release --flavor primary -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=production
```

Connectivity guard for Android presentation builds:
- Do not set `HABLE_API_BASE_URL` to a localhost or LAN URL.
- Do not rely on `adb reverse`; the app must reach `https://hable.pages.dev` directly.
- Confirm `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` includes `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`.

To target a dedicated staging backend alias:
```bash
flutter run --release --flavor primary -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=staging \
  --dart-define=HABLE_STAGING_API_BASE_URL=https://staging-hable.pages.dev
```

## Install APKs via ADB
Install the **primary** APK on a connected USB device:
```bash
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-primary-release.apk
```

Install the **partner/friend** APK on a connected USB device:
```bash
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-friend-release.apk

Android build and smoke tooling is host-portable. Keep Android SDK
`platform-tools` on `PATH`, or set `ANDROID_HOME`/`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`; no SDK
path or device identifier is committed. Build one release flavor with an
explicit environment:
```bash
scripts/build_android_release.sh --flavor primary --env production
scripts/build_android_release.sh --flavor friend --env production
```

Run the bounded smoke harness against one supplied device. It fails when no
device or more than one device is available, leaves normal onboarding/auth
intact, and writes only a small sanitized artifact record:
```bash
scripts/android_smoke.sh --flavor primary --env production \
  --mode release --device <device-id> --apk build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-primary-release.apk
```
For the local twin fixture, pass both seed values explicitly and use the
operator's chosen device; the harness never creates accounts or assumes a
particular emulator:
```bash
scripts/android_smoke.sh --flavor primary --env local --device <device-id> \
  --seed-user-id local-user-1 --seed-username Alice
```
```

## Build & Install on iOS via USB
To build and install the **primary** flavor directly to a connected iOS device:
```bash
flutter run --release --flavor primary -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=production
```
```bash
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign --flavor primary -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=production
```
To build for iOS simulator:
```bash
flutter build ios --simulator --flavor primary -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=production
```


To build and install the **partner/friend** flavor to a connected iOS device:
```bash
flutter run --release --flavor friend -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=production
```

Compile the friend flavor without signing:
```bash
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign --flavor friend -t lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=production
```

The production iOS identities are `com.hable.app.primary` / `Hable Primary`
and `com.hable.app.friend` / `Hable Friend`. Use the flavor schemes for
archives; the base `Runner` scheme is only a non-flavor development target.
Inject team/profile values through the protected archive environment:
```bash
xcodebuild -workspace ios/Runner.xcworkspace -scheme primary \
  -configuration Release-primary archive \
  -archivePath build/ios/archive/primary.xcarchive \
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM="$APPLE_TEAM_ID" \
  PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER="$APPLE_PRIMARY_PROFILE"

scripts/verify_ios_archive.sh \
  --archive build/ios/archive/primary.xcarchive --flavor primary
```
Repeat with `friend`, `Release-friend`, and the friend profile. If the team,
certificate, or profile is absent, archive must fail with a signing error;
never commit or embed those credentials.

*(Note: For iOS, `flutter run --release` is the most reliable way to compile and transfer the app to your device over USB in one step. If you only want to install an already-built iOS app without running it, you can simply use `flutter install`.)*

Run the fail-closed preflight before either flavor. It pins the reusable iOS
26.5 simulator fixture, reports Xcode/runtime/destination identifiers, and
fails rather than selecting a generic or ineligible destination:
```bash
scripts/ios_smoke.sh --preflight-only --runtime 'iOS 26.5'
```
If the runtime is missing, install the supported platform through Xcode and
rerun the preflight:
```bash
xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS
```
When preflight passes, build/install/launch each flavor with an explicit
environment and the same simulator UDID. The runner writes one bounded
metadata file and one startup screenshot per run:
```bash
scripts/ios_smoke.sh --flavor primary --env production --mode release \
  --device <simulator-udid>
scripts/ios_smoke.sh --flavor friend --env production --mode release \
  --device <simulator-udid>
```
For each launched flavor, manually exercise loading/error, retry/reconnect,
logout, and relaunch in the fixture and record those checkpoints beside the
generated evidence. A missing runtime or ineligible device remains `BLOCKED`,
not a passing iOS gate; see [#167](https://github.com/EmilGabibov/HABLE_Project/issues/167).

iOS does not register the unsupported Workmanager recap-prefetch path. Local
reminders still use the explicit notification permission/schedule/cancel flow;
the recap optimization is Android-only and is never a startup dependency.

## macOS
### Clean
Clean Flutter artifacts and remove the native macOS build folder:
```bash
flutter clean
rm -rf build/macos
```

### Build
Build a local debug macOS app:
```bash
flutter build macos --debug --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=local
```

Build a release macOS app:
```bash
flutter build macos --release --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=production
```

### Run
Run the macOS app from source during local development:
```bash
flutter run -d macos \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=local
```

### Verify
Verify the built release bundle on macOS:
```bash
codesign -dvvv --entitlements :- "build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Hable.app"
spctl -a -vv "build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Hable.app"
```

The current macOS auth policy is intentionally process-local: every new app
process starts signed out, and auth fields do not participate in credential
autofill. A release smoke must verify that explicit login works for the current
process and that relaunch returns to the signed-out screen without a Keychain
prompt.

## Release Evidence Capture

Capture these alongside the parity result; never paste secrets, tokens,
passwords, certificates, or provisioning profiles:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
git show -s --format=%cI HEAD
flutter --version
```

```bash
shasum -a 256 build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-primary-release.apk
shasum -a 256 build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-friend-release.apk
APKSIGNER="$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/build-tools/36.1.0/apksigner"
"$APKSIGNER" verify --print-certs build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-primary-release.apk
"$APKSIGNER" verify --print-certs build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-friend-release.apk
```

If build-tools `36.1.0` is not installed, set `APKSIGNER` to the `apksigner`
inside the build-tools version selected by the current Android build. Do not
commit a developer-specific SDK path.

```bash
xcodebuild -version
xcrun simctl list runtimes
xcodebuild -workspace ios/Runner.xcworkspace -scheme primary -showdestinations
```

```bash
shasum -a 256 build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Hable.app/Contents/MacOS/Hable
codesign -dvvv --entitlements :- build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Hable.app
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=4 build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Hable.app
spctl -a -vv build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Hable.app
```

## Windows
### Clean
Clean Flutter artifacts. Removing the Windows build folder must be done from a Windows shell:
```bash
flutter clean
```
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build\windows
```
```cmd
rmdir /s /q build\windows
```

### Build
Build a local debug Windows app:
```bash
flutter build windows --debug
```

Build a release Windows app:
```bash
flutter build windows --release
```

### Run
Run the Windows app from source during local development:
```bash
flutter run -d windows \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=local
```

### Output
The release bundle is written to:
```text
build/windows/x64/runner/Release/
```

---

## Linux
### Clean
Clean Flutter artifacts and remove the native Linux build folder:
```bash
flutter clean
rm -rf build/linux
```

### Build
Build a local debug Linux app:
```bash
flutter build linux --debug
```

Build a release Linux app:
```bash
flutter build linux --release
```

### Run
Run the Linux app from source during local development:
```bash
flutter run -d linux \
  --dart-define=HABLE_APP_ENV=local
```

### Output
The release bundle is written to:
```text
build/linux/x64/release/bundle/
```

## Host Constraints
- `flutter build macos` and `flutter run -d macos` require a macOS host.
- `flutter build windows` and `flutter run -d windows` require a Windows host.
- `flutter build linux` and `flutter run -d linux` require a Linux host.
- Windows installer packaging is a separate Windows-only step after `flutter build windows --release`; see `Developement/windows_distribution.md`.
- macOS signing, notarization, and App Store export are separate operator steps after `flutter build macos --release`; see `Developement/macos_distribution.md`.
