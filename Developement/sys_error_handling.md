# Error Handling and Safe Display Reference

This document defines the current reference direction for error handling across Hable's Flutter client and Cloudflare Worker backend.

The goal is to keep errors:
- safe for users to read,
- useful for debugging,
- consistent across screens and routes,
- and aligned with Hable's offline-first architecture.

## 1. Current Problem Shape

The codebase currently mixes several patterns:
- backend JSON responses like `{ "error": "..." }` with route-specific wording,
- frontend `throw Exception(response.body)` paths that can leak raw payloads,
- widget-level `Text('Error: $e')` fallbacks that expose internal exception strings,
- and ad hoc success/failure `SnackBar` copy across screens.

This creates three risks:
- inconsistent user experience,
- accidental leakage of implementation details,
- and duplicated parsing/display logic across Flutter screens and providers.

## 2. Core Safety Rules

### Frontend

- Never show raw exception objects directly to users.
- Never render `response.body` verbatim in UI.
- Route first-party fallback/error copy through `AppLocalizations` when the surface is localized; do not keep new user-visible safety strings embedded as English literals in providers, widgets, or screens.
- Prefer bounded user-facing copy such as:
  - `Couldn't load your friends right now.`
  - `Couldn't save this change. Try again.`
  - `Session expired. Please sign in again.`
- Log richer technical details only to debug output, not to visible UI.
- Use one normalization layer so screens do not each invent their own parsing.
- Prefer modern, calm wording with a light Hable touch: direct, slightly warm, and never blamey.

### Backend

- Return structured JSON for failures.
- Keep user-facing `message` text safe and concise.
- Keep optional debug-only detail separate from the default user-facing field.
- Do not expose stack traces, SQL, token contents, internal URLs, or plugin/runtime details in public responses.
- Use HTTP status codes consistently so Flutter can map them deterministically.

## 2.1 Tone Reference

Error copy should feel:
- calm,
- concise,
- actionable,
- and a little human.

Examples:
- `That took too long. Give it another try.`
- `That habit did not stick yet. Please try again.`
- `Hable could not load your friends right now.`
- `That PIN does not look right.`

Avoid:
- `Error: Exception: ...`
- `Failed to fetch`
- `Unauthorized: Not accepted friends`
- jokey copy that makes failures feel dismissive

## 2.2 Cross-Platform / Cross-Build Differences

Hable needs one visible error language across:
- Flutter web browser fetch/CORS failures,
- Android and iOS network timeouts,
- macOS and Windows desktop connectivity issues,
- local development builds using localhost/tunnels,
- and offline-first screens that still have cached Drift data.

Important differences:
- Web often surfaces failures as `XMLHttpRequest error`, `TypeError`, or `Failed to fetch`.
- Native mobile and desktop more often surface `SocketException`, `HandshakeException`, or timeout exceptions.
- Development builds can fail due to backend boot/CORS/base-URL issues more often than production.

Raw platform/build exceptions may differ, but the user-facing copy should normalize to one safe message policy.
That policy also needs to stay language-aware: if the surrounding surface is localized, the normalized safe message should come from the active locale resources rather than a hard-coded English fallback.

## 3. Target Contract

### Backend response shape

Preferred error envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "friend_request_self",
    "message": "You can't send a friend request to yourself."
  }
}
```

Guidance:
- `code`: stable machine-readable identifier.
- `message`: safe user-facing message.
- Optional diagnostics should stay server-side or be gated to development only.

### Frontend normalized shape

Preferred normalized model:

```dart
class AppError {
  final String code;
  final String message;
  final AppErrorKind kind;
}
```

Where `kind` can help the UI choose presentation:
- `inline`
- `snackbar`
- `banner`
- `fullscreen`
- `retryable`
- `auth`
- `validation`

## 4. Display Rules by Surface

### Inline form errors

Use for:
- validation failures,
- auth form issues,
- field-specific correction.

Examples:
- missing username/password,
- invalid email,
- short password,
- invalid PIN.

### SnackBars

Use for:
- short-lived action feedback,
- non-blocking failures after user actions,
- success/failure on local mutations where the user remains on the same screen.

Do not use SnackBars as the only recovery path for persistent permission problems.

### Empty/error panels

Use for:
- failed section loads,
- retryable fetch failures,
- offline-unavailable secondary content.

These should avoid raw `Error: ...` text.

### Full-screen blockers

Use only when the user cannot proceed safely:
- startup auth bootstrap failure,
- required session loss,
- unrecoverable route bootstrap states.

The universal startup splash is not an error owner. Forced-reset and web-version
checks fail open through their existing bounded guards, and the web version
status request times out after three seconds. Once auth restoration and those
guards resolve, the splash hands off to `AppGate`, which continues to own any
localized loading, cached-data, auth, or safe full-screen error surface.

## 5. Offline-First Boundaries

Because Hable is offline-first:
- network failure should usually degrade to cached Drift-backed UI rather than a hard failure,
- sync failures should prefer quiet logging plus bounded retry state,
- UI should distinguish:
  - `no local data yet`,
  - `offline with cached data`,
  - `request failed but local state is still usable`.

Do not let one sync failure replace stable local content with a noisy raw error.

When cached content exists:
- keep the content visible,
- show bounded inline or banner feedback only where needed,
- and prefer retry/recovery over full-screen blocking states.

## 6. Status-Code Mapping Guidance

Recommended default mapping:
- `400`: validation or malformed request
- `401`: auth/session expired
- `403`: not allowed
- `404`: missing resource
- `409`: state conflict / already handled / duplicate action
- `422`: semantically invalid input if introduced later
- `429`: throttled / try again later
- `500+`: generic server failure

Frontend should map these into safe copy first, then use backend `error.code` and `error.message` where present.

## 7. Immediate Audit Targets

Known current hotspots:
- `lib/screens/social/social_hub_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/profile_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/auth_screen.dart`
- `lib/widgets/habit_form_sheet.dart`
- `lib/main.dart`
- `lib/services/sync_service.dart`
- `lib/providers/calendar_provider.dart`
- `backend/src/index.ts`

Common anti-patterns to remove:
- `Text('Error: $e')`
- `throw Exception(response.body)`
- `SnackBar(content: Text('Failed ...: $e'))`

## 8. Testing Reference

Verification should cover:
- backend route returns stable error envelope,
- frontend parser extracts safe message and code,
- raw exception text is not shown in visible UI,
- offline/cached surfaces remain usable during fetch failure,
- auth-expired flows redirect or re-prompt cleanly,
- retry affordances exist where the action is retryable.

Cross-platform verification should include:
- one web-style fetch/CORS normalization path,
- one timeout/network-failure path representative of native builds,
- and one offline-with-cached-data path where the screen remains usable.
