Raw source: Add a habit, set a time, sync it, update it, delete it. see it in your friends app (if you added them as friend), update it in your friends app, see it in your app. do the same for multi-day habits. after adding them in your app, add them in your friends app, see them in your app. test everything. Update docs.
- [x] Transferred 2026-07-09 -> **Wire Friend Requests Through Social Hub And Twin-Harness Verification** (`Task1_Engineered.md#wire-friend-requests-through-social-hub-and-twin-harness-verification`).

Raw source: a list of habits we have at onboarding should be available on home page as well, so that we can add them to our list of habits in our profile. during creation user should able to radd partners (requesst will be send to partner to accept or deny). rewise the logic behind having the days inside the ring and having a streak (fire) trend next to the ring, seems duplicate info.

    Implementation Guidelines
    1. Analyze the component structure and identify all required dependencies
    2. Review the component's argumens and state
    3. Identify any required context providers or hooks and install them
    4. Questions to Ask
    - What data/props will be passed to this component?
    - Are there any specific state management requirements?
    - Are there any required assets (images, icons, etc.)?
    - What is the expected responsive behavior?
    - What is the best place to use this component in the app?

    Steps to integrate
    0. Copy paste all the code above in the correct directories
    1. Install external dependencies
    2. Fill image assets with Unsplash stock images you know exist
    3. Use lucide-react icons for svgs or logos if component requires them

- [x] Transferred 2026-07-11 -> **Add Partnership Roles And Enforce Habit Permissions In Backend** (`Task1_Engineered.md#add-partnership-roles-and-enforce-habit-permissions-in-backend`). Raw source: 1. Database Roles & Relationships (High Priority Blocker)
* **Objective:** Expand the D1 `partnerships` table to support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via a `role` enum to prevent client-side state conflicts.
* **Owner:** Can edit/delete the habit, complete/skip, and nudge participants.
* **Partner:** Can complete/skip, view details, and nudge others. Cannot edit/delete the habit.
