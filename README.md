Hable is an offline-first habit tracker for building consistent routines with a little more warmth and accountability. It combines a Flutter client, local Drift storage, background synchronization, and a Cloudflare Pages/Worker backend for accounts and social features.

Hable is local-first: the app can record and display habit activity without a
network connection, while the backend remains authoritative for synchronized
social state and scoring.

## What it includes

- Offline-first habit tracking with local SQLite/Drift persistence.
- Background sync to Cloudflare D1 with server-owned scoring.
- Shared habits, friendships, nudges, activity, and a friends-only leaderboard.
- Local inverted-index search for project and app content.
- Responsive Flutter targets for Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, and web.
- Localization for English, German, Farsi, Russian, Tamil, and Urdu.
- Accessibility-minded interaction states, recovery paths, and automated tests.

## Architecture

```text
Flutter UI
  ├─ Riverpod providers and services
  ├─ Drift / SQLite local database
  └─ background sync and notifications
          │
          ▼
Cloudflare Pages + Worker (Hono)
  ├─ authentication and profile APIs
  ├─ habit, friendship, and social sync
  ├─ server-owned score and achievement rules
  ├─ D1 relational database
  └─ KV for short-lived social state
```

The client remains usable while offline. The backend is the authority for synchronized social state and scoring; the client renders cached server results.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/` | Flutter application, providers, services, database, and widgets |
| `test/` | Flutter unit and widget tests |
| `backend/` | Cloudflare Pages Functions, D1 schema, and deployment scripts |
| `e2e/` | Playwright browser and accessibility tests |
| `Developement/` | Architecture, QA, release, and product documentation |
| `.github/` | CI, issue templates, pull request guidance, and dependency automation |

Local review artifacts, generated exports, UI dumps, and machine-specific
files are ignored. The repository keeps `Developement/` published because it
contains the architecture and issue-engineering contract. See
[`Developement/issue_engineering.md`](Developement/issue_engineering.md) for a
visual guide to the workflow.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK compatible with the Dart constraint in `pubspec.yaml`.
- Node.js and npm for the backend and Playwright tests.
- Wrangler for local Cloudflare development and deployment.
- Doppler or another approved secret-management workflow for deployed secrets.

### Install and run the Flutter app

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Generate localization and provider/database code when needed:

```bash
flutter gen-l10n
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Run the backend locally

```bash
cd backend
npm ci
npm run setup:doppler
npm run dev
```

Do not commit `.env` files, API tokens, database credentials, or production bindings. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Verification

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test

cd backend
npm ci
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run smoke:regression
```

Browser tests require a running target and the environment described by the Playwright configuration:

```bash
cd e2e
npm ci
npm test
```

## Deployment

The production web deployment is Pages-based. Review `backend/wrangler.toml` and the operator commands in [`Developement/commands.md`](Developement/commands.md) before deploying. Deployment requires access to the configured Cloudflare account, D1 database, KV namespace, service binding, and secret store.
